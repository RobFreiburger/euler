This repo collects solutions from study groups in the SacRuby (http://sacruby.info) meetup group
who are using the http://projecteuler.net/ problem set.

To add your solution to the collection, find (or create) a directory at the top level for
the problem number you are working on. Then include a directory with your github handle as a name
and drop your self contained solution in there.

Include a README.md file in your solution directory if necessary. Gemfiles or other environment
setup files are fine, but most folks are working on solutions with only Ruby (2.0 or 1.9.3)
and a base gem environment set up. Many folks use rspec too.
